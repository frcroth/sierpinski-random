This is a small script from my school days, which draws a [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) using random numbers.

This is a well known example of a [chaos game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game). Using turtle, it produces a Sierpiński triangle, which is a nice looking fractal.

This script (without some enhancements) was created at a course at the ["Mathematische Schülergesellschaft Leonhard Euler"](http://didaktik.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/de/schule/msg-schuelergesellschaft) some years ago.

### Troubleshooting

To get it to work, I had to do some searching.
